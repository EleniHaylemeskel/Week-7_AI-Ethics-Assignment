Bonus Task: Policy Proposal - Ethical AI in Healthcare
Objective: Establish guidelines to ensure AI systems in healthcare are responsible, fair, and patient-centered.

    1. Patient Consent Protocols
Informed Consent: Patients must be clearly informed about AI usage, data collection, and intended outcomes before any automated decision-making.
Opt-In Mechanism: Participation in AI-assisted diagnostics or treatment recommendations should be voluntary.
Right to Withdraw: Patients can revoke consent at any time, with their data removed from AI training pipelines.
    2. Bias Mitigation Strategies
Diverse Training Data: Ensure datasets represent different demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, medical history) to avoid biased predictions.
Fairness Audits: Periodically evaluate AI models using metrics such as demographic parity, equalized odds, and false positive/negative rates across patient groups.
Algorithmic Adjustments: Apply reweighing, adversarial debiasing, or threshold adjustments to reduce disparities in healthcare recommendations.
    3. Transparency Requirements
Explainable AI: Systems must provide human-understandable explanations for predictions, diagnoses, or treatment suggestions.
Documentation: Maintain detailed records of model architecture, training data sources, and validation results.
Reporting & Accountability: Establish protocols for reporting errors, unintended outcomes, or potential biases. Assign human oversight for all high-stakes decisions.

    Summary:
 AI in healthcare must prioritize patient autonomy, fairness, and safety. Adhering to consent protocols, implementing rigorous bias mitigation, 
and maintaining transparency ensures AI tools enhance healthcare outcomes without compromising ethical standards.
