Part 4: Ethical Reflection
Prompt: Reflect on a personal project (past or future). How will you ensure it adheres to ethical AI principles?

Reflection:
In a future project where I plan to develop a personalized e-commerce recommendation system, I will ensure ethical AI principles are integrated at every stage:
    1. Fairness: I will audit recommendation algorithms to prevent bias against any demographic group. For example, I will ensure products from 
        small or minority-owned businesses are fairly represented.
    2. Transparency: Users will be informed about how their data is used for recommendations. Clear documentation will explain the logic behind the suggestions.
    3. Explainability: Recommendations will include human-understandable justifications, e.g., “This product is suggested based on your previous purchases and similar users’ interests.”
    4. Privacy & Data Protection: I will follow GDPR and other privacy standards, using minimal data collection and anonymization where possible. Users can opt in or out of data usage.
    5. Accountability: I will include human oversight to review algorithm outputs periodically, especially if automated decisions could disadvantage certain users.

By proactively considering fairness, transparency, explainability, privacy, and accountability, this project will align with responsible 
AI practices and promote trust among users while minimizing unintended harm.
